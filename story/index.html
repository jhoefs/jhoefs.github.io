							<h1>Peace Patrol</h1>
							<p class="major">I just finished sitting in on Crestone's "Peace Patrol" for six weeks. Sat in the same room with Peace Patrol members, looked them in the whites of their eyes. 
<br><br>
Ostensibly, the theory is that "Peace Patrol" reduces social problems, creating "peace" - that's the theory, at least.

							<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>
							<p>When I first moved to Crestone, I found a lot of people had faith in Peace Patrol, mostly for ideological reasons (even though few had actual experience with them). As I have a long standing passion for communication, community, and peace-making, I was curious to see what it was all about.
							<br><br>
							My own experience has been much different than the propaganda; while I think Peace Patrol may occasionally facilitate a positive social transaction, by and large I have observed a corrupt and even dangerous vigilante group.
<br><br>
I've observed endemic croneyism, and a disturbing lust for railroading in the short time I've observed them. It is quite frankly shocking, and raises deep concerns about the ethical and moral implications of what "Peace Patrol" has become, as opposed to what it puts itself out there as being.

							<h2>Back-Patting</h2>
							<p>Recently, a member of their group was in a roommate dispute situation, and Peace Patrol was called in to mediate. The individual did not even trouble themselves to participate in the proceedings, or embody a willingness to be an advocate for peaceful solutions, because they knew they had the "brute squad" in their back pocket. Instead, they used bullying tactics to try and navigate through and get what they wanted in the situation, being intimately coached and encouraged in this by other Peace Patrol members all along the way. This individual, and many more, have been motivated to join Peace Patrol not from a sincere community concern, but from a vicarious desire to have the backing of the brute squad when they need it.
<br><br>
Throughout the Crestone community, people know that if they have "Peace Patrol" on their side, they have power in conflict situations. This gives rise to the croneyism and corruption mentioned earlier, and countermands the social value of the organization. 
<br><br>
They like to solicit themselves as being morally and ethically better than the police, but I have not seen the truth in this assessment.<!--, the police have the accountability of the courts, whereas this rogue organization has no accountability--></p>

							<h2>Railroading</h2>
							<p>There are times when the name for this organization would be more appropriately the "Railroading Patrol" or "Brute Patrol". Reiterating old paradigms of how to deal with problems. Not too different from the police. 
<br><br>
They bill themselves as model citizens that set an example for the rest of the community, but I have not observed this to be true. 
<br><br>
Even before coming to Crestone, I heard stories from friends about some of the atrocities, individuals literally being physically bullied out of town by "Peace Patrol". And I have witnessed many examples since observing them, where they steward miscarriages of justice, ostracization, and even mentor their croneys in bullying tactics. 
<br><br>
Including towards my own person, it is normalized and permissioned to not even give a thought to hearing both sides of a situation, and to act upon that, to not even look people in the whites of their eyes. Instead, they are internally committed to their own agendas and croneyism. 
<br><br>
It is social agenda, and it is social engineering.

							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>From where I come from, this level of negligence is irresponsible in an organization that claims to steward peace. 
<br><br>
Perhaps some young person out there has the creative insight to create the next generation of Kofi's original vision: often the snake has to die before the new skin can emerge (I'm more of an artist than a literalist so don't try and analyze that metaphor too literally :-)
<br><br>
But seriously, to be in a place where, once things actually went down, it didn't even cross their mind to listen to and understand both parties, because one party was Peace Patrol croney, and the willingness to railroad an innocent person, I don't feel safe in Crestone now <i>because of</i> Peace Patrol, these are people I sat in the same room with for 6 weeks, it's shocking the degree of depersonalization and moral relativism that has been normalized in "Peace Patrol", and I would encourage people to strongly question the propaganda of this organization, and even more strongly question trusting them with their affairs.</p>
